## Week 1:
  - ### Day 1

      <div>
      idea: 
      get Mic input and create interactable sketch

      problem: 
      Web technologies safety standarts

      Web browser didn't get the input from the mic, p5 was throwing error messages, some older sketches still working the new ones didn't worked.

      Solution:
      Took an older sketch and copy paste the mic part, 
      wrote a intro page to get trough the chrome safety part
      ( create user input before audio can play ), 

      realization:
      Mic input consists only of volume, no frequenzies possible.
      </div>
